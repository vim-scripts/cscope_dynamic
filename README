cscope_dynamic is a VIM plugin that enables very fast cscope database updates for C/C++ codebases. It accomplishes this by using two cscope databases; a large one, and a small one. When a file is written it is moved to the small database, which can update in a matter of seconds - often sub-second. The file is then removed from the large database to avoid duplicate updates. Subsequent writes to the same file only trigger a small database update. The initial move from the large to small database is a one time cost. This works well because you're often only modifying a subset of files at a time.
